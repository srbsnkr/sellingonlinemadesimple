INSTALLING / UPDATING
=====================
This package will install all the extensions in the package.
Install this package by use of the standard installer in your Joomla! administrator.

If you already have this extension installed, this package will automatically update it.
So you do not need to uninstall the extension(s) first.

TROUBLESHOOTING
===============
If for some reason the installation fails, you can try to install it manually as explained here:
http://docs.joomla.org/Installing_an_extension

Please make sure your setup/server meets the minimum requirements for the extension.
You can find these requirements under the 'Specs' tab on the extension details page on
http://www.nonumber.nl

PHP 5.2 can cause problems during installation.
Please note that the extensions need at least php 5.3 to function correctly.
